# [Internet of Things]

Winter 2015 | Volume 22, No. 2

This forward-thinking issue focuses on the Internet of Things or IoT, a progressive state 
of the Internet in which every single device in the physical world is connected and possesses 
the ability to communicate with one another. By 2020, 6.4 billion devices will be connected 
to this network; the IoT has the ability to both reflect upon and transform the reality that 
it mirrors. In this issue we hear from Vint Cerf, the father of the Internet, on some 
challenges that this configuration poses. Cornell University's Dr. Alyssa Apsel and 
Enkhbayasgalan Gantsog discuss  pivotal issues in building the IoT, such as the 
synchronization that creates the “connectivity” of the network. Other articles in this 
issue address: communication in the IoT, construction of the network, powering the devices, 
data transmission, as well as responses from academia and industry to this new technology.
